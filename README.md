## Guillaume PLASSAN

Ph.D. in computer science & Senior Software R&D with 8+ years of professional experience designing and implementing innovative algorithms with a strong emphasis on multithreaded graph traversals and Boolean algebra.

Main skillset:
- Software engineering (architecture, implementation, project management, bug tracking)
- Algorithms and Data structures (multithreading, graph theory, complexity theory)
- Electronic Design Automation (static analysis, formal verification, FPGA prototyping)
- ASIC/FPGA Design (Verilog, CDC, RDC, timing)
- Autonomous Driving (perception pipeline, high-performance computing)

I'm mostly interested in facing complex open-ended problems, collaborating with teams of diverse backgrounds and architecting efficient algorithmic solutions.
